# ACCESS-Community-Hub Organisation

This repository contains organisation level information.


## Repository administration and membership

Repositories hosted in this organisation are maintained by the Community for the Community. To make this possible and ensure that everyone can contribute effectively, clear roles and responsibilities are necessary, along with some basic rules about how repositories are managed.

### Roles and Responsibilities:

- Repository Administrators:
  - Manage access permissions for their repository, including granting write or maintainer privileges.
  - Ensure repository policies and best practices are followed.
  - Act as the final authority for changes in their repository.
  - Advertise how users can request write access to the repository.
- Organisation Administrators:
  - Create new repositories.
  - Assign initial repository admins.
  - Add members to the organisation.
  - Provide support and guidance on organisational policies.

### Repository and organisation membership

Repositories in this organisation are administered by different people, and most users will usually only need write access to one or two repositories. As such, we recommend that access be granted per repository, instead of being granted at the organisation level. A common exception to this would be members that need to be part of a GitHub team, as only organisation members can join teams. If you would like to include a person as a member of this organisation, please get in touch with the organisation admins or create an issue in the [.github](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/.github) repository.

Furthermore, we have the following policies about organisation-wide permissions:
 - No special access is granted at the organisation level to members. This means that organisation members:
   - cannot write to repositories unless they have been granted explicit write access at the repository level or are part of a team that has such permissions
   - cannot read private repositories unless they have been granted explicit read access at the repository level or are part of a team that has such permissions.
 - With the exception of the admin team, no team shall be granted organisation-wide privileges.

### Repository administration and creation

1. Repository Administration
   - Each repository must have at least two administrators.
   - Repository admins are responsible for managing user permissions for their repositories
   - Teams can be created and used to manage access to repositories, but any such team should be clearly associated with a well defined repository or collection of repositories. Anyone creating a team must set themselves as a maintainer for that team.

2. Repository Creation
   - Only organisation admins can create new repositories.
   - To request the creation of a new repository, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/.github/issues/new) in the [.github](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/.github) repository of this organisation.
   - Once a repository is created, organisation admins will assign initial repository admins.
   - All repositories should be public to promote open collaboration, but exceptions can be made, in particular for licensing reasons.
