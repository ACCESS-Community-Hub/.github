## ACCESS Community Hub

This GitHub organisation is where members of the ACCESS Community can contribute documentation
and other related material. It is a shared space to enable, coordinate and foster collaboration.

None of the repositories contained in this Organisation are directly supported by the 
[ACCESS-NRI](https://www.access-nri.org.au) and should be considered as maintained by the Community 
for the Community. Material supported directly by the ACCESS-NRI is hosted on the 
[ACCESS-NRI GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI).

ACCESS-NRI retains formal administrative control of this organisation. Access is
given to ACCESS-NRI staff and community members who wish to contribute. The
procedure to request access should be described in the README of each
repository.

Community members who wish to host a repository in this organisation should read
our [repository administration policy](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/.github/README.md) and create a new
[issue](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/.github/issues/new/choose)
requesting the creation of a new repository.
